# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 challenge entails the use of javascript and plotly to build and interactive dashboard to explore a dataset called belly button boidiversity dataset. This dataset contains a group of 
microbial organism that colonize human navels. The dataset discloses that a handful of the microbes also called operational taxonomics units, OTUs, in the study were present in more than 70% of people, whiles the 
rest were relatively rare. Javascript D3 library was used to read in the samples.json file from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
Horizontal bar bar charts with dropdown meneu were created  with sample_values as the values otu_ids as the labels and otu_ids as the hovertext for the charts
Bubble chats was also created using the otu_ids as the x values, sample_values as the y values, samples_values as the marker size, otu_ids as marker colors and otu_labels for the text values.
I made use of lecture notes and classes activities during this challenge. Additionally, I visited other websites for codes and references previous challenges.
